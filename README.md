# 👋 Hi, nice to see you, I’m Zeyuan (Wendell) Wang

I'm passionate about **routing algorithms**, **backend systems**, **AI + optimization**, and building software that solves real-world engineering problems.  
I enjoy designing multi-objective algorithms, backend services, and scalable infrastructure that bridge **AI, systems, and data engineering**.

🎓 I am currently a **Master of Electrical and Computer Engineering (AI & Systems Track)** at **Rice University**.  
Before that, I earned my **B.S. in Computer Science and Technology** from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

💼 Previously, I worked as a **Software Engineer Intern** at Deloitte AI Institute, Bosch (BSH), and Baidu.  
I built large-scale pipelines, backend systems, microservices, and ML/AI features used by real customers and enterprise teams.
